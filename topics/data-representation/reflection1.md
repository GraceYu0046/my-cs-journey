Over the past few weeks we have covered various topics under data representation, including: the representation of strings and integers, bit & byte, binary system, hexadecimal system, Unicode, ASCII, color representation, boolean algebra, and logic gates. 


First, I will be sharing my notes on these topics. 

Intro to data representation:

Next, I will share one of my homework assignments. The assignment was to convert integers from decimal to binary:

To summarize what we learned, we also created a poster titled "Types of Data Representation" including all the major data representation topics covered in class:
