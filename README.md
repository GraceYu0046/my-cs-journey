## Introduction
Hi! My name is Grace and I am a CS student. 

I will be documenting my learning process in CS here. 

*Let's start with an introduction of myself!*

I am a beginner in computer science, and I am really excited to learn new things this year, and this blog can let me remember how much I have accomplished throughout the year! 

Here is an image that I really like. This is a blurry picture of Pinkie Pie, a character from the cartoon My Little Pony.

## My first project - setting up my blog

Today I set up this blog using GitHub pages. This is the place I where I will periodically reflect on what I've learned in future lessons.
