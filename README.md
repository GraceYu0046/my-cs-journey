# my-cs-journey
## Introduction
Hi! My name is Grace and I am a CS student. 

I am starting this blog to document my CS journey. 

*Let's start with an introduction of myself!*

I've just started learning DP Computer Science, and I am really excited to try new things this year. This blog can remind me of how much I have achieved throughout the year! 

Here is an image that I really like. This is a slightly blurry picture of Pinkie Pie, a character from the cartoon My Little Pony. I decided to put this image here because Pinkie Pie is one of my favorite characters. She is always *optimistic* and *eager* to try everything. A goal that I want to set for my CS journey is to **approach every task _enthusiastically_, no matter how challenging that task may be.**

## Elaborating on my goals

Of course, a big part of my goals is **improving on my programming skills and learning more about computing systems**. However, I believe there is more to achieve in CS than simply knowing how to code. 

For one, I want to go in depth on **computational thinking**, thouroughly understanding how computers approach and solve a problem. This will allow me to adopt the computer's way of thinking when giving instructions to a computer. **Moreover, I want to understand how to approach complex real-life problems _systematically_.**

Also, aiming for success in CS allows me to practice **_resilience, persistence, and self-discipline_**, all important core values that will continue to *help me beyond my studies in this course*. 

For more information about these core values, please check out a [poster](https://keystoneacademy-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/huici_yu_student_keystoneacademy_cn/EVlkeYgzTOJLpiRdlpCrfx8BMNq98o2C4sxRRWpmhILenw?e=kRtp7m) that we created. 

## My first project - setting up my blog

Today I set up this blog using GitHub pages. This is the place I where I will periodically reflect on what I've learned in future lessons.
